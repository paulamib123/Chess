Title: Notation

### **Some notations for this code**

##### **1. Notation for pieces**
k -> king  
r -> rook  
b -> bishop  
q -> queen  
p -> pawn  
n -> knight  

All the black pieces are represented by using small letters.  
All the white pieces are represented by using capital letters.  

An empty block is represented by a space.

##### **2. Notation for moves**

**a. Notation for Piece Capture**

When a piece makes a capture, an x is inserted between the initial and the destination square.  

For example, Bxe5 (bishop captures the piece on e5).

**b. Notation for Pawn Capture**

When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial.  

For example, exd5 (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5).

**c. Notation for Pawn Promotion**

If a pawn moves to its last rank, achieving promotion, the piece chosen is indicated after the move. 

For example, f8Q, f8B

**d. Notation for Castling**

1. Queenside Castling  
It is indicated by O-O-O

2. Kingside Castling  
It is indicated by O-O

**e. Notation for Enpassant**

If the move ends with ep it is an enpassant move.

For example, exd6ep
