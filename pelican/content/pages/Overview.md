### **Input Format**

The input is a pgnfile in text format.

### **Output Format**

The output is the board view which is in the form of a dictionary where the key is the name of the block and the value is the piece present on that block.

The chess project consists of four python scripts and are as follows:

### **1. checkmove.py**
This python script determines weather a move is valid or not.

### **2. pgnparser.py**
This python script is used to parse the pgn file and finally obtain the moves in the form of alphanumericals.

### **3. pawn.py**
This python script handles all the moves that can be made by a pawn.

### **4. piece.py**
This python script handles all the moves that can be made by all the other pieces except the pawns.

### **5. main.py**
This python script is the main driver code.
