The chess project consists of four python scripts and are as follows:

#### 1. checkmove.py
This python script determines weather a move is valid or not.

#### 2. pawn.py
This python script handles all the moves that can be made by a pawn.

#### 3. piece.py
This python script handles all the moves that can be made by all the other pieces except the pawns.

#### 4. main.py
This python script is the main driver code.
