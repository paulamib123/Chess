<p>Chess is a board game of strategic skill for two players, played on a chequered board on which each playing piece is moved according to precise rules. The object is to put the opponent's king under a direct attack from which escape is impossible ( checkmate ).</p>
<h2><strong>Settings up the board</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Some Basic Moves</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>King</li>
</ul>
<p>King can move exactly one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. </p>
<ul>
<li>Queen</li>
</ul>
<p>Queen can move any number of vacant squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rook</li>
</ul>
<p>Rook can move any number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bishop</li>
</ul>
<p>Bishop can move any number of vacant squares in any diagonal direction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Knight</li>
</ul>
<p>Knight can move one square along any rank or file and then at an angle.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pawns</li>
</ul>
<p>Pawns can move forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not yet moved, the pawn has the option of moving two squares forward provided both squares in front of the pawn are unoccupied. A pawn cannot move backward. Pawns are the only pieces that capture differently from how they move. They can capture an enemy piece on either of the two spaces adjacent to the space in front of them (i.e., the two squares diagonally in front of them) but cannot move to these spaces if they are vacant. </p>
<h2><strong>Enpassant</strong></h2>
<p>En Passant may only occur when a pawn is moved two squares on its initial movement. When this happens, the opposing player has the option to take the moved pawn “en passant” as if it had only moved one square. This option, though, only stays open for one move.</p>
<h2><strong>Pawn Promotion</strong></h2>
<p>Promotion in chess is a rule that requires a pawn that reaches its eighth rank to be converted by the player's choice of a bishop, knight, rook, or queen of the same color . The new piece replaces the pawn on the same move.</p>
<h2><strong>Castling</strong></h2>
<p>For castling the following rules have to be followed: </p>
<p>The king and the rook may not have moved from their starting squares if you want to castle.
All squares between the king and the rook must be empty.
The king cannot be in check.
The squares that the king passes over must not be under attack, nor the square where it lands on.</p>
